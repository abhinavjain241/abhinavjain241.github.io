Well, as I stated in my previous post, I have been living in Switzerland for the past 4 weeks, and am here till mid-July. I am here for an internship at the [Laboratory of Robotics and Automation](http://larae.populus.ch/) at [Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud \(HEIG-VD\)](http://heig-vd.ch). Yeah, I know it takes a while to digest the name.

It has been an amazing experience up till now. I have made various friends from all parts of the world. And I also managed to do some traveling during my stay here at [Yverdon-les-Bains](https://goo.gl/maps/6XxTUR6P2R82).

Of course, in this extremely connected world with Internet, it's not hard to find whatever you're looking for, so I had already done my research before coming here. I knew that Yverdon would be a small town, and I would be doing traveling since it would be my first time in Europe, so I ordered a [EURail](http://www.eurail.com/) pass for myself online, and luckily I got an extra travel day because of an offer that was going on at the time I bought it. I bought a 4 country pass for 8 (+ 1 free day) travel days covering **France**, **Italy**, **Switzerland** and the **Benelux** (Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg). Yes, the Indian in me wanted to optimize and get as many countries to travel as possible. :stuck_out_tongue:

By the time I am writing this blog post, I have had the chance to explore almost most of Yverdon, (though I haven't really went to the best part of the city, as people say, the [Neuchatel Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Neuch%C3%A2tel), but I hope I will go soon), go hiking to [Le Chasseron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Chasseron) (a Mountain Peak in Jura Mountains), a little bit of [Vevey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vevey) and [Aigle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aigle) (Thanks to my uncle), some of [Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne) (Just Port d'Ouchy and nearby places), and also [La Rochelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle) in France (I know this is really an odd one out, but a friend is doing an internship there, so visited him), meanwhile stopping at **Paris** (momentarily though, and even then it was raining), **Niort**, **Strasbourg**, **Basel** and **Olten** in the round trip.

A major personal development for me has been learning how to cook, as I had never really done it before. I already knew I would have to do this before coming here, because thanks to Swiss prices, you can't eat at a restaurant outside if you plan to spend less than 20 CHF for a basic one-time meal. Through various tests and experiments followed by failures, I have managed to learn few basic dishes including Pasta, Omelette, French Toast, Salads, along with some Indian dishes like Dal (Lentils) and Pulao, using the knowledge imparted to me in the 1-2 days of my stay at home before coming here. I also got the chance to eat dishes from various parts of the world, thanks to my friends at the university, we organize something called an **International Dinner**, where everyone cooks and brings some dish(es) from their country's cuisine and then we eat together.

There also have been few events and parties organized by the student group called [AGE](https://www.facebook.com/age.heig.vd/) at the university, like a Mafia-themed soirée (evening party), a Spanish free buffet (Tapas) with complementary drinks like Sangria, Mojito and Tequila, and the [Baleinev Festival](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleinev_Festival) (A music festival held annually in Yverdon), and I enjoyed every moment of them.

Leaving all the personal stuff aside, I have found that Swiss people put emphasis on quality in everything, and live a much richer life in all aspects. There is absolutely no pollution that I have seen myself (no noise pollution and emissions from cars are minimal), and a majority of the country's electricity thrives on hydroelectric power. Also, Switzerland has a very high recycling rate (almost all of the trash is segregated into different containers, and recycled accordingly), and the citizens are very rule-abiding. It is an absolute pleasure to walk and cross the roads, when people stop their vehicles to let you go (a very rare sight seen (or maybe not) in India).

Most of the cities and towns are well connected through the railway network, and you can even take your bicycle inside the train, making your travel even easier. People here love to go on hiking, mountaineering, and other expeditions, and I was surprised to see such an organized hiking trail with signboards at every 2-3 miles.

And yes, did I mention the blazing fast Internet speed that you get here? 700 Mb/s is pretty normal at the university, and the one at my accommodation might be a little less, around 300 Mb/s. :stuck_out_tongue:

Finally coming to my work, I feel delighted to work with my [professor](http://jdze.populus.org/). He has an experience of more than 20 years in his field, and he's a pretty chill guy when it comes to discussing any problem with him. My project involves building a bridge between the existing framework in use here, i.e Piaget (named after a Swiss psychologist) and the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/), while developing models for the different equipment present in the lab. I, along with my co-interns got the chance to exhibit various demonstrations at the [SwissEurobot](http://www.swisseurobot.ch/) competition, and also got to see some pretty amazing robots that were made by teams from all across Switzerland, Germany and France. Not to mention that we got free food and beer on the last day (so much that I got few bottles back home!).

All this was just for the month of May, and I look forward to having more and even better experiences in the upcoming months of June and July, about which I'll keep blogging. :smiley:

Till then, Ciao!

<!-- Commenting because too detailed.

Arriving here on the 4th of May, I was already tired because of the 14 hour flight, with the jet lag taking a toll on me, but I somehow managed to meet the guy who was going to meet me at the station, and found out he was also a student at the same university. I then had to meet my professor on that very day, and had no time to even lay my head down for a while. (Seriously? How can you schedule a meeting on that very day when your Asian intern has been traveling for more than half of the day?)

But anyways, I did what was expected from me, bought a train ticket, called up the guy, called back home to tell them that everything was alright and rushed to the platform to catch my train (At that time, I didn't realize that the tickets were valid for a given time, not just for a specific train). So as I waited, I turned on Wi-Fi on my phone, and connected to the free internet service provided by SBB (Swiss Rail Network), and I thought to myself, "I'll wait until it shows a 100 popups, and then prompt me to enter my details, and then will kill me with the slow speed that generally all the public free service networks are plagued with", but I was completely wrong. A single window appeared, of course they asked me to fill in my details, (They want to ensure you're living and you're human, and not a terminator who's barged into the train station), but once that was done, I was completely blown away with the speed. Lightning fast. Never expected from a free service. Holy Shit, Switzerland jumped even higher in my wish list of places to live at that moment. In no time, I was replying to messages on WhatsApp, browsing my feed on Instagram and even downloaded a full online map of some cities in Switzerland in few seconds. I was loving it, until my train arrived, and damn I had to let go of it.

I sat in the train, put my luggage on the side, and laid myself on the comfortable chair. As the train started moving, a thought of checking Wi-Fi on the train came to my mind, but "Naah.", it wasn't there. Well that was okay, I was just being too optimistic. Anyway, so I sat and admired the scenery outside as the train flew (literally) past those green fields and the misty mountains (Haha, Tolkien reference), but little did I know that I was going to see all that (and even better) again in the coming months. I slept for the rest of my time on the train, given the fact that I was so damn tired, but finally managed to make it to my destination. Met the guy, Ismael, nice fellow, he showed me around a little bit, and I also got to know that there was a 4 day weekend coming ahead of me (It was a Wednesday that day) on the account of Ascension Day (celebrated all across Europe), and I thought to myself whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. Had I known that earlier, I might have directly come on the 9th, would have spent some days with my Family, and not have been so stressed for 4 consecutive days to pack my stuff. But also on the other hand, I got 4 free days to relax, explore the place at my own pace, get settled down in the meantime. Given that I had no choice, so I had the latter.

I reached my accommodation in a few while, where I met my landlady who greeted me, and explained the whole system of the house in French, which was hard for me to understand (It is, even now, but I've got a little better), but I had Ismael translate everything for me, and in the end, she took me to my room.

The room was really nice, had a double bed, a sofa, two tables, a complete wardrobe, another rack, and a TV as well. She told me the TV wasn't working and she would call the guy who would fix that, but I just said that I don't really watch TV, and she could just skip doing that.

So I kept my stuff, took out the little gift that I had got for my professor, put it in my bag, and left for the university. Reached there at 4:30, met my [professor](http://jdze.populus.org/), and we sat down and discussed some things about my to-be project. He explained some of the stuff about his study in [Cognitics](http://cognitics.populus.ch/), and at some point, I was just nodding along, because I was too sleepy.

He left at 5:30, after which he told me we would meet the coming Monday, and I also gave him the gift that I had got from home (Indian Tea), then went to meet Ismael again. He had some work, so he told me to take the bus to the station, where I could buy the required stuff for the weekend (because all the other supermarkets were closed at the time), and then go back to my accommodation after that.

And, so I did, went back to my accommodation, changed my clothes, ate some of the food that I was carrying, and crashed on the bed. I woke up straight at 4 AM on the next day.
